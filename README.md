# Dining philosophers problem
## Description:
In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.
It was originally formulated in 1965 by Edsger Dijkstra as a student exam exercise, presented in terms of computers competing for access to tape drive peripherals. Soon after, Tony Hoare gave the problem its present formulation

# Sleeping barber problem
## Description:
In computer science, the sleeping barber problem is a classic inter-process communication and synchronization problem between multiple operating system processes. The problem is analogous to that of keeping a barber working when there are customers, resting when there are none, and doing so in an orderly manner.
The Sleeping Barber Problem is often attributed to Edsger Dijkstra (1965), one of the pioneers in computer science.

# The Bear and the Honeybees
## Description:
Here are a few clarifications about the problem:
* A bee that tries to store honey in the pot while the bear is eating will be eaten by the bear.
* If the bear tries to eat the honey before the pot is full, the bees will sting the bear.
* A bee that tries to add honey to a full pot will drown (this is before the bear gets to the full pot; afterwards, the bee will be eaten by the bear).
* Your solution should allow the bees to fill the pot as quickly as possible.
